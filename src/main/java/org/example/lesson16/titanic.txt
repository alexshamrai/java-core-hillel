'''RMS ''Titanic''''' was a British passenger and mail carrying [[ocean liner]], operated by the [[White Star Line]], that [[Sinking of the Titanic|sank in the North Atlantic Ocean]] on 15 April 1912 [[Iceberg that struck the Titanic|as a result of striking an iceberg]] during her maiden voyage from [[Southampton]], England, to [[New York City]], United States. Of the [[Sinking of the Titanic#Casualties and survivors|estimated 2,224 passengers and crew]] aboard, about 1,500 died, making it [[List of accidents and disasters by death toll#Maritime|the deadliest sinking of a single ship]] up to that time.{{efn|The death toll of the sinking of ''[[Tek Sing]]'' in 1822 is not known exactly, but it may have exceeded that of ''Titanic''.}} The disaster drew public attention, spurred major changes in maritime safety regulations, and inspired many artistic works.

[[Royal Mail Ship|RMS]] ''Titanic'' was the [[Timeline of largest passenger ships|largest ship afloat]] at the time she entered service and the second of three {{sclass|Olympic|ocean liner|1}}s built for the White Star Line. She was built by the [[Harland and Wolff]] shipbuilding company in [[Belfast]]. [[Thomas Andrews|Thomas Andrews Jr.]], the chief naval architect of the shipyard, died in the disaster. ''Titanic'' was under the command of Captain [[Edward Smith (sea captain)|Edward John Smith]], who [[The captain goes down with the ship|went down with the ship]]. The ocean liner carried some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from the [[British Isles]], [[Scandinavia]], and elsewhere throughout Europe, who were seeking a new life in the United States and Canada.

The first-class accommodation was designed to be the pinnacle of comfort and luxury, with a gymnasium, swimming pool, smoking rooms, high-class restaurants and cafes, a [[Victorian Turkish baths|Victorian-style Turkish bath]], and hundreds of opulent cabins. A high-powered [[radiotelegraph]] transmitter was available for sending passenger "marconigrams" and for the ship's operational use. ''Titanic'' had advanced safety features, such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors, contributing to her reputation as "unsinkable".

''Titanic'' was equipped with 16 lifeboat [[davit]]s, each capable of lowering three lifeboats, for a total of 48 boats. Despite this capacity of 48, the ship was only equipped with a total of [[lifeboats of the RMS Titanic|20 lifeboats]]. Fourteen were regular lifeboats, two were [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] lifeboats, and four were collapsible and proved difficult to launch while she was sinking. Together, the 20 lifeboats could hold 1,178 people—about half the number of passengers on board, and one-third of the number of passengers the ship could have carried at full capacity (a number consistent with the [[maritime safety]] regulations of the era). The British Board of Trade's regulations required 14 lifeboats for a ship 10,000 tonnes. ''Titanic'' carried six more than required, allowing 338 extra people room in lifeboats. When the ship sank, the lifeboats that had been lowered were only filled up to an average of 60%.

[[File:Titanic Disaster - Genuine Footage (1911-1912).webm|thumbnail|[[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont]] newsreel containing the only known footage of ''Titanic'', 1912.|left]]
The name ''Titanic'' derives from [[Titans|the Titans of Greek mythology]]. Built in [[Belfast]], Ireland, in what was then the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]<!--DO NOT ALTER, Northern Ireland did not exist in 1912!-->, [[Royal Mail Ship|RMS]] ''Titanic'' was the second of the three {{sclass|Olympic|ocean liner|1}}s—the lead vessel was {{RMS|Olympic}} and the final ship in the class was {{HMHS|Britannic}}.{{sfn|Chirnside|2004|p=319}}  They were by far the largest vessels of the British shipping company [[White Star Line]]'s fleet, which comprised 29 steamers and tenders in 1912.{{sfn|Beveridge|Hall|2011|p=27}} The three ships had their genesis in a discussion in mid-1907 between the White Star Line's chairman, [[J. Bruce Ismay]], and the American financier [[J. P. Morgan]], who controlled the White Star Line's parent corporation, the [[International Mercantile Marine Co.]] (IMM).

White Star faced an increasing challenge from its main rivals, [[Cunard Line]]—which, with the aid of the [[Royal Navy]], had recently launched the twin sister ships {{RMS|Lusitania||2}} and {{RMS|Mauretania|1906|2}}, the fastest passenger ships then in service—and the German lines [[Hamburg America Line|Hamburg America]] and [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]]. Ismay preferred to compete on size rather than speed and proposed to commission a new class of liners that would be larger than anything that had gone before, as well as being the last word in comfort and luxury.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=26}} White Star sought an upgrade of its fleet primarily to respond to the introduction of the Cunard giants but also to considerably strengthen its position on the Southampton–Cherbourg–New York service that had been inaugurated in 1907. The new ships would have sufficient speed to maintain a weekly service with only three ships instead of the original four. Thus, ''Olympic'' and ''Titanic'' would replace {{RMS|Teutonic}} of 1889, {{RMS|Majestic|1889|6}} of 1890 as well as {{RMS|Adriatic|1906|6}} of 1907. {{RMS|Oceanic|1899|6}} made her first departure from her new homeport in June 1907. Her running mates on the Southampton-New York run were the ''Teutonic'', ''Majestic'', and the new ''Adriatic''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Oceanic 1899 – 1914 |url=http://thegreatoceanliners.com/articles/oceanic-ii/ |publisher=The Great Ocean Liners |author=Daniel Othfors |date=19 March 2018 |access-date=2 February 2024}}</ref> ''Majestic'' resumed her old position on the White Star Line's New York service after the loss of ''Titanic''.<ref name="SS Majestic Back in Service">{{cite news|title=Outgoing Steamships – Sail Saturday, October 26, 1912: Majestic (Southampton)|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030272/1912-10-24/ed-1/seq-15/#date1=1912&index=8&rows=20&words=Majestic+Ss&searchType=basic&sequence=0&state=&date2=1912&proxtext=SS+Majestic&y=11&x=18&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=1|access-date=18 May 2015|newspaper=The Sun|date=24 October 1912|archive-date=27 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627164237/http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030272/1912-10-24/ed-1/seq-15/#date1=1912&index=8&rows=20&words=Majestic+Ss&searchType=basic&sequence=0&state=&date2=1912&proxtext=SS+Majestic&y=11&x=18&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=1|url-status=live}}</ref>

The ships were constructed by the Belfast shipbuilder [[Harland & Wolff]], which had a long-established relationship with the White Star Line dating back to 1867.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=25}} Harland and Wolff were given a great deal of latitude in designing ships for the White Star Line; the usual approach was for [[Gustav Wilhelm Wolff|Wilhelm Wolff]] to sketch a general concept, which [[Edward Harland|Edward James Harland]] would turn into a ship design. Cost considerations were a relatively low priority; Harland & Wolff were authorised to spend what it needed on the ships, plus a five per cent profit margin.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=25}} In the case of the ''Olympic''-class ships, a cost of £3&nbsp;million (approximately £{{Inflation|UK-GDP|3|1912|fmt=c|r=-1}} million in {{Inflation/year|UK-GDP}}) for the first two ships was agreed plus "extras to contract" and the usual five per cent fee.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=12}}

Harland and Wolff put their leading designers to work designing ''Olympic''-class vessels. The design was overseen by [[William Pirrie, 1st Viscount Pirrie|Lord Pirrie]], a director of both Harland and Wolff and the White Star Line; [[naval architect]] [[Thomas Andrews]], the managing director of Harland and Wolff's design department; Edward Wilding, Andrews's deputy and responsible for calculating the ship's design, stability and trim; and [[Alexander Carlisle]], the shipyard's chief draughtsman and general manager.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=14}} Carlisle's responsibilities included the decorations, equipment, and all general arrangements, including the implementation of an efficient [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] [[davit]] design.{{efn|Carlisle would leave the project in 1910, before the ships were launched, when he became a shareholder in [[Axel Welin|Welin Davit & Engineering Company Ltd]], the firm making the ship's davits.<ref name="TIPCarlisle"/> Wilding was sacked following the ''Titanic'' disaster, having been unfairly blamed by Pirrie for the ship's loss.{{sfn|McCluskie|1998|p=20}}}}

On July 29, 1908, Harland and Wolff presented the drawings to J. Bruce Ismay and other White Star Line executives. Ismay approved the design and signed three "letters of agreement" two days later, authorising the start of construction. {{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=55}} At this point, the first ship—which was later to become ''Olympic''—had no name but was referred to simply as "Number 400", as it was Harland and Wolff's four-hundredth hull. ''Titanic'' was based on a revised version of the same design and was given the number 401. {{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=56}}

== Dimensions and layout ==
[[File:Titanic Starboard View 1912.gif|thumb|upright=1.5|Starboard view drawing of ''Titanic.'']]
''Titanic'' was {{convert|882|ft|9|in|m}} long with a maximum breadth of {{convert|92|ft|6|in|m}}.

Her total height, measured from the base of the keel to the top of the bridge, was {{convert|104|ft|m}}.{{sfn|McCluskie|1998|p=22}} She measured {{GRT|46329}} and {{NRT|21831}}<ref>{{cite book |year=1911 |title=Lloyd's Register of British and Foreign Shipping |volume=II.–Steamers |location=London |publisher=[[Lloyd's Register]] of Shipping |at=TIR–TIT |url= https://archive.org/details/HECROS1912ST/page/n1006/mode/1up |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref> and with a draught of {{convert|34|ft|7|in|m}}, she displaced 52,310 tons.{{sfn|Chirnside|2004|p=319}}
All three of the ''Olympic''-class ships had ten decks (excluding the top of the officers' quarters), eight of which were for passenger use. From top to bottom, the decks were:
* The '''boat deck''', on which the lifeboats were housed. It was from here during the early hours of 15 April 1912 that ''Titanic''{{'}}s lifeboats were lowered into the North Atlantic. The bridge and wheelhouse were at the forward end, in front of the captain's and officers' quarters. The bridge stood {{convert|8|ft|m}} above the deck, extending out to either side so that the ship could be controlled while docking. The wheelhouse stood within the bridge. The entrance to the First Class [[Grand Staircase of the RMS Titanic|Grand Staircase]] and gymnasium were located midships along with the raised roof of the First Class lounge, while at the rear of the deck were the roof of the First Class smoke room and the relatively modest Second Class entrance. Just forward of the Second Class entrance sat the kennels, where the First Class passengers' dogs would stay. The wood-covered deck was divided into four segregated promenades: for officers, First Class passengers, engineers, and Second Class passengers respectively. Lifeboats lined the side of the deck except in the First Class area, where there was a gap so that the view would not be spoiled.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=47}}{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=229}}
* '''A Deck''', also called the '''promenade deck''', extended along the entire {{convert|546|ft|m}} length of the [[superstructure]]. It was reserved exclusively for First Class passengers and contained First Class cabins, the First Class reading and writing room, lounge, smoke room, and Palm Court.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=47}}
* '''B Deck''', the '''bridge deck''', was the top weight-bearing deck and the uppermost level of the hull. More First Class passenger accommodations were located here with six palatial staterooms (cabins) featuring their own private promenades. On ''Titanic'', the à la carte restaurant and the Café Parisien provided luxury dining facilities to First Class passengers. Both were run by subcontracted chefs and their staff; all were lost in the disaster. The Second Class smoking room and entrance hall were both located on this deck. The raised forecastle of the ship was forward of the bridge deck, accommodating Number 1 hatch (the main hatch through to the cargo holds), numerous pieces of machinery and the anchor housings.{{efn|It was kept off-limits to passengers; the famous "flying" scene at the ship's bow from the 1997 film ''Titanic'' would not have been permitted in real life.}} Aft of the bridge deck was the raised [[poop deck]], {{convert|106|ft|m}} long, used as a promenade by Third Class passengers. It was where many of ''Titanic''{{'}}s passengers and crew made their last stand as the ship sank. The forecastle and poop deck were separated from the bridge deck by [[well deck]]s.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=48}}{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=232}}
* '''C Deck''', the '''shelter deck''', was the highest deck to run uninterrupted from stem to stern. It included both well decks; the aft one served as part of the Third-Class promenade. Crew cabins were housed below the forecastle and Third-Class public rooms were housed below the poop deck. In between were the majority of First Class cabins and the Second-Class library. {{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=48}}{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=233}}
* '''D Deck''', the '''saloon deck''', was dominated by three large public rooms—the First-Class reception room, the First-Class dining saloon and the Second-Class dining saloon. The first- and second-class galleys were also located on this deck. An open space was provided for Third Class passengers. First, Second- and Third-Class passengers had cabins on this deck, with berths for firemen located in the bow. It was the highest level reached by the ship's watertight bulkheads (though only by eight of the fifteen bulkheads).{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=48}}{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=235}}
* '''E Deck''', the '''upper deck''', was predominantly used for passenger accommodation for all three classes plus berths for cooks, seamen, stewards and [[Coal trimmer|trimmers]]. Along its length ran a long passageway nicknamed 'Scotland Road', in reference to [[Scotland Road|a famous street in Liverpool]]. Scotland Road was used by Third Class passengers and crew members.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=48}}{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=236}}
* '''F Deck''', the '''middle deck''', was the last complete deck, and mainly accommodated Second- and Third-Class passengers and several departments of the crew. The Third Class dining saloon was located here, as was the First Class bath complex, containing the swimming pool and the [[Turkish bath]].{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=48}}{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=236}}<ref>{{cite web |last=Eveleth |first=Rose |author-link=Rose Eveleth |title=The Definitive Guide to the Dogs on the Titanic |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/definitive-guide-dogs-titanic-180950319/ |website=Smithsonian |access-date=17 October 2018 |date=31 March 2014 |archive-date=6 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210106103018/https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/definitive-guide-dogs-titanic-180950319/ |url-status=live}}</ref>
* '''G Deck''', the '''lower deck''', was the lowest complete deck that carried passengers,{{clarify|date=December 2023}} and had the lowest portholes, just above the waterline. The first-class squash court was located here along with the travelling post office where letters and parcels were sorted ready for delivery when the ship docked. Food was also stored here. The deck was interrupted at several points by [[orlop]] (partial) decks over the boiler, engine and turbine rooms.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=48}}{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=237}}
* The '''orlop decks''', and the '''tank top''' below that, were on the lowest level of the ship, below the waterline. The orlop decks were used as cargo spaces, while the tank top—the inner bottom of the ship's hull—provided the platform on which the ship's boilers, engines, turbines and electrical generators were housed. This area of the ship was occupied by the engine and boiler rooms, areas which passengers would have been prohibited from seeing. They were connected with higher levels of the ship by two flights of stairs in the fireman's passage; twin spiral stairways near the bow provided access up to D Deck.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=48}}{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=237}} Ladders in the boiler, turbine, and engine rooms provided access to higher decks in those compartments.

''Titanic'' propulsion was supplied by three main engines—two [[Reciprocating engine|reciprocating]] four-[[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]], [[triple-expansion]] [[steam engine]]s and one centrally placed low-pressure [[Steam turbine|Parsons turbine]]—each driving a [[Propeller (marine)|propeller]]. The two reciprocating engines had a combined output of {{convert|30000|hp|abbr=out|sigfig=2|lk=on}}. The output of the steam turbine was {{convert|16000|hp|abbr=out|sigfig=2}}.{{sfn|McCluskie|1998|p=22}} The White Star Line had used the same combination of engines on an earlier liner, {{SS|Laurentic|1908|2}}, where it had been a great success.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=120}} It provided a good combination of performance and speed; reciprocating engines by themselves were not powerful enough to propel an ''Olympic''-class liner at the desired speeds, while turbines were sufficiently powerful but caused uncomfortable vibrations, a problem that affected the all-turbine Cunard liners {{RMS|Lusitania||2}} and {{RMS|Mauretania|1906|2}}.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=121}} By combining reciprocating engines with a turbine, fuel usage could be reduced and motive power increased, while using the same amount of steam.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=79}}

The two reciprocating engines were each {{convert|63|ft|m}} long and weighed 720 tons, with their bedplates contributing a further 195 tons.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=121}} They were powered by steam produced in 29 boilers, 24 of which were double-ended and five single-ended, which contained a total of 159 furnaces.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=80}} The boilers were {{convert|15|ft|9|in|m}} in diameter and {{convert|20|ft|m}} long, each weighing 91.5 tons and capable of holding 48.5 tons of water.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=126}}

They were fuelled by burning coal, 6,611 tons of which could be carried in ''Titanic''{{'}}s [[Fuel bunker|bunkers]], with a further 1,092 tons in Hold 3. The furnaces required over 600 tons of coal a day to be shovelled into them by hand, requiring the services of 176 [[Fireman (steam engine)|firemen]] working around the clock.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=148}} 100 tons of ash a day had to be disposed of by ejecting it into the sea.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=86}} The work was relentless, dirty and dangerous, and although firemen were paid relatively well,{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=148}} there was a high suicide rate among those who worked in that capacity.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=85}}

Exhaust steam leaving the reciprocating engines was fed into the turbine, which was situated aft. From there it passed into a [[surface condenser]], to increase the efficiency of the turbine and so that the steam could be condensed back into water and reused.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=96}} The engines were attached directly to long shafts which drove the propellers. There were three, one for each engine; the outer (or wing) propellers were the largest, each carrying three blades of manganese-bronze alloy with a total diameter of {{convert|23.5|ft|m}}.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=126}} The middle propeller was slightly smaller at {{convert|17|ft|m}} in diameter,{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=127}} and could be stopped but not reversed.

''Titanic''{{'}}s electrical plant was capable of producing more power than an average city power station of the time.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=74}} Immediately aft of the turbine engine were four 400&nbsp;kW steam-driven electric generators, used to provide electrical power to the ship, plus two 30&nbsp;kW auxiliary generators for emergency use.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=106}} Their location in the stern of the ship meant they remained operational until the last few minutes before the ship sank.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=107}}

''Titanic'' lacked a searchlight, in accordance with the ban on the use of searchlights in the merchant navy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://northneuk.com/2012/11/19/why-no-searchlights-on-titanic/|title=Why No Searchlights On Titanic?|date=19 November 2012|access-date=9 February 2019|archive-date=6 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210106102944/https://northneuk.com/2012/11/19/why-no-searchlights-on-titanic/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1912/06/01/archives/naval-ban-on-searchlights-nonuse-by-merchant-ships-due-to-british.html|title=NAVAL BAN ON SEARCHLIGHTS; Non-Use by Merchant Ships Due to British Admiralty, It Is Charged.|first=Marconi Transatlantic Wireless Telegraph To the New York|last=Times|date=1 June 1912|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=9 February 2019|archive-date=6 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210106102947/https://www.nytimes.com/1912/06/01/archives/naval-ban-on-searchlights-nonuse-by-merchant-ships-due-to-british.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Technology ===
==== Compartments and funnels ====
The interiors of the ''Olympic''-class ships were subdivided into 16 primary [[Compartment (ship)|compartments]] divided by 15 bulkheads that extended above the waterline. The eleven vertically closing watertight doors on the orlop deck could be closed automatically via a switch on the bridge, by a lever next to the door itself, or by an automatic buoyancy mechanism that would activate in the event water reached six feet high in the compartment.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=44}} There were also several other horizontally closing watertight doors along Scotland Road, and various crew and third class passenger spaces on the G, F, and E decks. These doors required a small key to be placed into a slot on the deck above. Once the key was turned, the watertight door would close. The ship's exposed decking was made of pine and [[teak]], while interior ceilings were covered in painted granulated [[Cork (material)|cork]] to combat condensation.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=104}} Standing above the decks were four funnels, each painted in the White Star [[Buff (colour)|buff]] with black tops; only three were functional—the aftmost one was a dummy, installed for aesthetic purposes, and providing ventilation to the kitchen, as well as the First and Second Class smoking rooms. Two masts, each {{cvt|155|ft|m}} high, supported [[derrick]]s for working cargo.

==== Rudder and steering engines ====
Due to the size and weight of ''Titanic''{{'}}s rudder—at {{convert|78|ft|8|in|m}} high and {{convert|15|ft|3|in|m}} long, weighing over 100 tons—that it required [[steering engine]]s to move it. Two steam-powered steering engines were installed, though only one was used at any one time, with the other one kept in reserve. They were connected to the short [[tiller]] through stiff springs, to isolate the steering engines from any shocks in heavy seas or during fast changes of direction.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=68}} As a last resort, the tiller could be moved by ropes connected to two steam [[Capstan (nautical)|capstans]].{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=70}} The capstans were also used to raise and lower the ship's five anchors (one port, one starboard, one in the centreline and two [[Anchor#Kedging|kedging anchors]]).{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=70}}

==== Water, ventilation and heating ====
The ship was equipped with her own waterworks, capable of heating and pumping water to all parts of the vessel via a complex network of pipes and valves. The main water supply was taken aboard while ''Titanic'' was in port, but in an emergency, the ship could also distil fresh water from seawater, though this was not a straightforward process as the distillation plant quickly became clogged by salt deposits. A network of insulated ducts conveyed warm air, driven by electric fans, around the ship, and First-Class cabins were fitted with additional electric heaters.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=74}}

''Titanic''{{'}}s radiotelegraph equipment (then known as [[wireless telegraphy]]) was leased to the White Star Line by the [[Marconi Company|Marconi International Marine Communication Company]], which also supplied two of its employees, [[Jack Phillips (wireless officer)|Jack Phillips]] and [[Harold Bride]], as operators. The service maintained a 24-hour schedule, primarily sending and receiving passenger telegrams ("marconigrams"), but also handling navigation messages including weather reports and ice warnings.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=162}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Beveridge|first1=Bruce|last2=Andrews|first2=Scott|last3=Hall|first3=Steve|last4=Klistorner|first4=Daniel|editor-last=Braunschweiger|editor-first=Art |title=Titanic: the ship magnificent|volume=one: Design & construction|date=2008|publisher=History Press|location=Stroud, UK|isbn=978-0752446066|edition=3rd}}</ref><ref name="auto">{{cite web |last=Hsu |first=Jeremy |title=How Marconi's Wireless Tech Helped Save Titanic Passengers |url= https://www.nbcnews.com/id/47046053/ns/technology_and_science-innovation/t/how-marconis-wireless-tech-helped-save-titanic-passengers/ |url-status=live |website=msnbc.com |date=17 April 2012 |access-date=24 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210106103008/https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna47046053 |archive-date=6 January 2021}}</ref>
The radio room was located on the Boat Deck, in the officers' quarters. A soundproofed "Silent Room", next to the operating room, housed loud equipment, including the transmitter and a motor-generator used for producing alternating currents. The operators' living quarters were adjacent to the working office. The ship was equipped with a 'state of the art' 5-kilowatt rotary [[spark-gap transmitter]], with the wireless telegraph [[Maritime call sign|call sign]] MGY, and communication was in [[Morse code]]. This transmitter was one of the first Marconi installations to use a rotary spark-gap, which gave ''Titanic'' a distinctive musical tone that could be readily distinguished from other signals. The transmitter was one of the most powerful in the world and guaranteed to broadcast over a radius of {{convert|350|mi|nmi km|0|abbr=out}}. An elevated [[T-antenna]] that spanned the length of the ship was used for transmitting and receiving. The normal operating frequency was 500&nbsp;kHz (600&nbsp;m wavelength); however, the equipment could also operate on the "short" wavelength of 1,000&nbsp;kHz (300&nbsp;m wavelength) that was employed by smaller vessels with shorter antennas.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=165}}

=== Passenger facilities ===

{{See also|Grand Staircase of the Titanic|l1=Grand Staircase of ''Titanic''}}

The passenger facilities aboard ''Titanic'' aimed to meet the highest standards of luxury. According to ''Titanic''{{'}}s general arrangement plans, the ship could accommodate 833 First Class Passengers, 614 in Second Class and 1,006 in Third Class, for a total passenger capacity of 2,453. In addition, her capacity for crew members exceeded 900, as most documents of her original configuration have stated that her full carrying capacity for both passengers and crew was approximately 3,547. Her interior design was a departure from that of other passenger liners, which had typically been decorated in the rather heavy style of a [[manor house]] or an [[English country house]].{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=57}}

''Titanic'' was laid out in a much lighter style similar to that of contemporary high-class hotels—the [[The Ritz London Hotel|Ritz Hotel]] was a reference point—with First Class cabins finished in the [[Empire style]].{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=57}} A variety of other decorative styles, ranging from the [[Renaissance]] to [[Louis XV Style|Louis XV]], were used to decorate cabins and public rooms in First and Second Class areas of the ship. The aim was to convey an impression that the passengers were in a floating hotel rather than a ship; as one passenger recalled, on entering the ship's interior a passenger would "at once lose the feeling that we are on board ship, and seem instead to be entering the hall of some great house on shore".{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=182}} Cabins in First Class also contained buttons that, when pressed, would signal for a steward to come to the cabin.

Among the more novel features available to first-class passengers was a {{cvt|7|ft}} deep saltwater swimming pool, a gymnasium, a [[squash (sport)|squash]] court, and a [[Victorian Turkish baths|Victorian-style Turkish bath]]{{sfn|Beveridge|2008|pp=416-423}} which comprised hot room, warm (temperate) room, cooling-room, and two shampooing (massage) rooms. Complementing the Turkish bath, and within the same area, was a steam room and an [[electric bath]].{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=182}} First-class common rooms were impressive in scope and lavishly decorated. They included a lounge in the style of the [[Palace of Versailles]], an enormous reception room, a men's smoking room, and a reading and writing room. There was an à la carte restaurant in the style of the [[The Ritz Hotel, London|Ritz Hotel]] which was run as a concession by the famous Italian restaurateur [[Luigi Gatti (businessman)|Gaspare Gatti]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-victim/gaspare-antonio-pietro-gatti.html|title=Gaspare Antonio Pietro Gatti : Titanic Victim|website=Encyclopedia Titanica|access-date=24 November 2019|archive-date=21 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221090820/https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-victim/gaspare-antonio-pietro-gatti.html|url-status=live}}</ref> A ''Café Parisien'' decorated in the style of a French sidewalk café, complete with ivy-covered trellises and wicker furniture, was run as an annex to the restaurant. For an extra cost, first-class passengers could enjoy the finest French ''haute cuisine'' in the most luxurious of surroundings.<ref name="NMNI 1st Class Cafe Parisien"/> There was also a ''Verandah Café'' where tea and light refreshments were served, that offered grand views of the ocean. At {{cvt|114|ft}} long by {{cvt|92|ft}} wide, the dining saloon on D Deck, designed by [[Charles Fitzroy Doll]], was the largest room afloat and could seat almost 600 passengers at a time.<ref>Brewster, Hugh & Coulter, Laurie.

Third Class (commonly referred to as [[steerage]]) accommodations aboard ''Titanic'' were not as luxurious as First or Second Class but were better than on many other ships of the time. They reflected the improved standards which the White Star Line had adopted for trans-Atlantic immigrant and lower-class travel. On most other North Atlantic passenger ships at the time, Third Class accommodations consisted of little more than open dormitories in the forward end of the vessels, in which hundreds of people were confined, often without adequate food or toilet facilities.

The White Star Line had long since broken that mould. As seen aboard ''Titanic'', all White Star Line passenger ships divided their Third Class accommodations into two sections, always at opposite ends of the vessel from one another. The established arrangement was that single men were quartered in the forward areas, while single women, married couples and families were quartered aft. In addition, while other ships provided only open berth sleeping arrangements, White Star Line vessels provided their Third-Class passengers with private, small but comfortable cabins capable of accommodating two, four, six, eight and ten passengers.{{sfn|Beveridge|2008|p=15}}

Third Class accommodations also included their own dining rooms, as well as public gathering areas including adequate open deck space, which aboard ''Titanic'' comprised the poop deck at the stern, the forward and aft well decks, and a large open space on D Deck which could be used as a social hall. This was supplemented by the addition of a smoking room for men and a general room on C Deck which women could use for reading and writing. Although they were not as glamorous in design as spaces seen in upper-class accommodations, they were still far above average for the period.

Leisure facilities were provided for all three classes to pass the time. As well as making use of the indoor amenities such as the library, smoking rooms, and gymnasium, it was also customary for passengers to socialise on the open deck, promenading or relaxing in hired deck chairs or wooden benches. A passenger list was published before the sailing to inform the public which members of the great and good were on board, and it was not uncommon for ambitious mothers to use the list to identify rich bachelors to whom they could introduce their marriageable daughters during the voyage.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=189}}

One of ''Titanic''{{'}}s most distinctive features was her First Class staircase, known as the [[Grand Staircase of the RMS Titanic|Grand Staircase]] or Grand Stairway. Built of solid [[English oak]] with a sweeping curve, the staircase descended through seven decks of the ship, between the boat deck to E deck, before terminating in a simplified single flight on F Deck.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=59}} It was capped with a dome of wrought iron and glass that admitted natural light to the stairwell. Each landing off the staircase gave access to ornate entrance halls panelled in the [[William and Mary style|William & Mary]] style and lit by [[ormolu]] and crystal light fixtures.{{sfn|Lynch|1992|p=53}}

At the uppermost landing was a large carved wooden panel containing a clock, with figures of "Honour and Glory Crowning Time" flanking the clock face.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=59}} The Grand Staircase was destroyed during the sinking and is now just a void in the ship which modern explorers have used to access the lower decks.{{sfn|Lynch|1992|p=207}} During the filming of James Cameron's ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' in 1997, his replica of the Grand Staircase was ripped from its foundations by the force of the inrushing water on the set. It has been suggested that during the real event, the entire Grand Staircase was ejected upwards through the dome.{{sfn|Merideth|2003|p=236}}

=== Mail and cargo ===
[[File:La Circassienne au Bain, After Blondel.JPG|thumb|upright| ''[[La Circassienne au Bain]]'' by [[Merry-Joseph Blondel]]; the most highly valued item of cargo lost on ''Titanic''. This image is of a copy.{{efn|Copy of the neoclassical oil painting by [[Merry-Joseph Blondel]]<ref name="New York Times 1913, p. 28">''New York Times'', Thursday 16 January 1913, ''Titanic Survivors Asking $6,000,000'', p.28.</ref>}}]]
Although ''Titanic'' was primarily a passenger liner, she also carried a substantial amount of cargo. Her designation as a [[Royal Mail Ship]] (RMS) indicated that she carried mail under contract with the [[Royal Mail]] (and also for the [[United States Post Office Department]]). For the storage of letters, parcels and specie (bullion, coins and other valuables), {{convert|26800|cuft|m3}} of space in her holds was allocated. The Sea Post Office on G Deck was manned by five postal clerks (three Americans and two Britons), who worked 13 hours a day, seven days a week, sorting up to 60,000 items daily.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=146}}

The ship's passengers brought with them a huge amount of baggage; another {{convert|19455|cuft|m3}} was taken up by first- and second-class baggage. In addition, there was a considerable quantity of regular cargo, ranging from furniture to foodstuffs, and a 1912 Renault Type CE [[Coupe de Ville]] motor car.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/auto/the-car-that-went-down-with-the-titanic|title=The car that went down with the Titanic|date=10 October 2016|website=Fox News|access-date=24 November 2019|archive-date=6 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210106103018/https://www.foxnews.com/auto/the-car-that-went-down-with-the-titanic|url-status=live}}</ref> Despite later myths, the cargo on ''Titanic''{{'}}s maiden voyage was fairly mundane; there was no gold, exotic minerals or diamonds, and one of the more famous items lost in the shipwreck, a jeweled copy of the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]'', was valued at only £405 (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|405|1912|r=-2}}}} today).{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1987|p=131}} According to the claims for compensation filed with Commissioner Gilchrist, following the conclusion of the Senate Inquiry, the single most highly valued item of luggage or cargo was a large neoclassical oil painting entitled ''[[La Circassienne au Bain]]'' by French artist [[Merry-Joseph Blondel]]. The painting's owner, first-class passenger [[Mauritz Håkan Björnström-Steffansson]], filed a claim for $100,000 ({{Inflation|US-GDP|100000|1912|fmt=eq|r=-5}}) in compensation for the loss of the artwork.<ref name="New York Times 1913, p. 28"/> Other intriguing items in the manifest included 12 cases of ostrich feathers, 76 cases of "Dragon's Blood," and 16 cases of Calabashes.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Titanic Cargo Manifest |date=28 August 2003 |url=https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/cargo-manifest.html}}</ref>

''Titanic'' was equipped with eight electric cranes, four electric winches and three steam winches to lift cargo and baggage in and out of the holds. It is estimated that the ship used some 415 tons of coal whilst in Southampton, simply generating steam to operate the cargo winches and provide heat and light.<ref>''The Titanic: The Memorabilia Collection'', by Michael Swift, Igloo Publishing 2011, {{ISBN|978-0-85780-251-4}}</ref>

=== Lifeboats ===
{{Main|Lifeboats of the Titanic|l1=Lifeboats of ''Titanic''}}
[[File:Titanic lifeboat.jpg|thumb|A collapsible lifeboat with canvas sides|left]]
Like ''Olympic'', ''Titanic'' carried a total of 20 lifeboats: 14 standard wooden Harland and Wolff lifeboats with a capacity of 65 people each and four Engelhardt "collapsible" (wooden bottom, collapsible canvas sides) lifeboats (identified as A to D) with a capacity of 47 people each. In addition, she had two emergency [[Cutter (boat)#Rowing|cutters]] with a capacity of 40 people each.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=112}}{{efn|Measurement of lifeboats: '''1–2:''' 25'2" long by 7'2" wide by 3'2" deep; {{convert|326.6|cuft|m3}}; '''3–16:''' 30' long by 9'1" wide by 4' deep; {{convert|655.2|cuft|m3}} and '''A–D:''' 27'5" long by 8' wide by 3' deep; {{convert|376.6|cuft|m3}} }} ''Olympic'' carried at least two collapsible boats on either side of her number one funnel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Olympic_sea_trials.jpg|title=RMS Olympic on sea trials with collapsible, port side, alongside #1 funnel|access-date=24 November 2019|archive-date=6 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210106102918/https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Olympic_sea_trials.jpg|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.alamy.com/photograph-of-the-rms-olympic-sister-ship-to-the-titanic-arriving-in-new-york-after-her-maiden-voyage-dated-1911-image210385191.html|title=Stock Photo – Photograph of the RMS Olympic, sister ship to the Titanic, arriving in New York after her maiden voyage.

Those on the starboard side were odd-numbered 1–15 from bow to stern, while those on the port side were even-numbered 2–16 from bow to stern.{{sfn|Lord|1997|p=78}}

Both cutters were kept swung out, hanging from the davits, ready for immediate use, while collapsible lifeboats C and D were stowed on the boat deck (connected to davits) immediately inboard of boats 1 and 2 respectively. A and B were stored on the roof of the officers' quarters, on either side of number 1 funnel. There were no davits to lower them and their weight would make them difficult to launch by hand.{{sfn|Lord|1997|p=78}} Each boat carried (among other things) food, water, blankets, and a spare life belt. Lifeline ropes on the boats' sides enabled them to save additional people from the water if necessary.

''Titanic'' had 16 sets of davits, each able to handle four lifeboats as Carlisle had planned. This gave ''Titanic'' the ability to carry up to 64 wooden lifeboats{{sfn|Chirnside|2004|p=26}} which would have been enough for 4,000 people—considerably more than her actual capacity. However, the White Star Line decided that only 16 wooden lifeboats and four collapsibles would be carried, which could accommodate 1,178 people, only one-third of ''Titanic''{{'s}} total capacity. At the time, the [[Board of Trade]]'s regulations required British vessels over 10,000 tons to only carry 16 lifeboats with a capacity of 990 occupants.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=112}}

Therefore, the White Star Line actually provided more lifeboat accommodation than was legally required.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=38}}{{efn|Since 1894, when the largest passenger ship under consideration was the [[Cunard Line]]'s 13,000-ton {{RMS|Lucania|3=2}}, the Board of Trade had made no provision to increase the existing scale regarding the number of required lifeboats for larger ships, such as the 46,000-ton ''Titanic''. Sir Alfred Chalmers, nautical adviser to the Board of Trade from 1896 to 1911, had considered the matter of adjusting the scale "from time to time", but because he not only assumed that experienced sailors would need to be carried "uselessly" aboard ship only to lower and man the extra lifeboats, but also anticipated the difficulty in getting away a greater number than 16 boats in any emergency, he "did not consider it necessary to increase [the scale]".<ref name="BritishInq"/>}} At the time, lifeboats were intended to ferry survivors from a sinking ship to a rescuing ship—not keep afloat the whole population or power them to shore. Had {{SS|Californian}} responded to ''Titanic''{{'s}} [[Distress signal|distress calls]], the lifeboats might have been able to ferry all passengers to safety as planned.<ref name=wsj1>{{cite news|title=The Real Reason for the Tragedy of the Titanic|last=Berg|first=Chris|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=13 April 2012|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304444604577337923643095442|access-date=8 August 2017|archive-date=14 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614194758/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304444604577337923643095442|url-status=live}}</ref>

The sheer size of the ''Olympic class'' vessels posed a major engineering challenge for Harland and Wolff; no shipbuilder had ever before attempted to construct vessels this size.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stufftheydontwantyoutoknow.com/podcasts/titanic.htm|title=Titanic Conspiracies|date=6 October 2017|work=Titanic Conspiracies {{!}} Stuff They Don't Want You to Know|access-date=9 October 2017|archive-date=27 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627230816/https://www.stufftheydontwantyoutoknow.com/podcasts/titanic.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> The ships were constructed on Queen's Island, now known as the [[Titanic Quarter, Belfast|Titanic Quarter]], in [[Port of Belfast|Belfast Harbour]]. Harland and Wolff had to demolish three existing [[slipway]]s and build two new ones, the largest ever constructed up to that time, to accommodate both ships.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=12}} Their construction was facilitated by an enormous gantry built by [[Sir William Arrol & Co.]], a Scottish firm responsible for the building of the [[Forth Bridge]] and London's [[Tower Bridge]]. The [[Arrol Gantry]] stood {{convert|228|ft|m}} high, was {{convert|270|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|840|ft|m}} long and weighed more than 6,000 tons. It accommodated a number of mobile cranes. A separate floating crane, capable of lifting 200 tons, was brought in from Germany.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=78}}

The construction of ''Olympic'' and ''Titanic'' took place virtually in parallel, with ''Olympic''{{'}}s keel laid down first on 16 December 1908 and ''Titanic''{{'}}s on 31 March 1909.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=56}} Both ships took about 26 months to build and followed much the same construction process. They were designed essentially as an enormous floating [[box girder]], with the [[keel]] acting as a backbone and the frames of the hull forming the ribs. At the base of the ships, a double bottom {{convert|5|ft|3|in|m}} deep supported 300 frames, each between {{convert|24|in|cm}} and {{convert|36|in|cm}} apart and measuring up to about {{convert|66|ft|m}} long. They terminated at the bridge deck (B Deck) and were covered with steel plates which formed the outer skin of the ships.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=42}}

The 2,000 hull plates were single pieces of [[rolling (metalworking)|rolled]] steel [[structural steel|plate]], mostly up to {{convert|6|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|30|ft|m}} long and weighing between 2.5 and 3 tons.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=43}} Their thickness varied from {{convert|1|in|cm}} to {{convert|1.5|in|cm}}.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=44}} The plates were laid in a [[Clinker (boat building)|clinkered]] (overlapping) fashion from the keel to the bilge. Above that point they were laid in the "in and out" fashion, where [[strake]] plating was applied in bands (the "in strakes") with the gaps covered by the "out strakes", overlapping on the edges. Commercial oxy-fuel and electric arc [[welding]] methods, ubiquitous in [[metal fabrication|fabrication]] today, were still in their infancy; like most other iron and steel structures of the era, the hull was held together with over three million iron and steel [[rivet]]s, which by themselves weighed over 1,200 tons. They were fitted using hydraulic machines or were hammered in by hand.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=87}} In the 1990s some material scientists concluded{{sfn|Felkins|Leighly|Jankovic|1998}} that the steel plate used for the ship was subject to being especially brittle when cold, and that this [[brittleness]] exacerbated the impact damage and hastened the sinking. It is believed that, by the standards of the time, the steel plate's [[quality (business)|quality]] was good, not faulty, but that it was inferior to what would be used for shipbuilding purposes in later decades, owing to advances in the [[metallurgy]] of [[steelmaking]].{{sfn|Felkins|Leighly|Jankovic|1998}} As for the rivets, considerable emphasis has also been placed on their quality and strength.{{sfn|Broad|1997}}{{sfn|Foecke|2008}}{{sfn|McCarty|Foecke|2012|p={{page needed|date=March 2012}}}}{{sfn|Broad|2008}}{{sfn|Verhoeven|2007|p=49}}

Among the last items to be fitted on ''Titanic'' before the ship's launch were her two side anchors and one centre anchor. The anchors themselves were a challenge to make, with the centre anchor being the largest ever [[Forging|forged]] by hand and weighing nearly 16 tons. Twenty [[Clydesdale horse|Clydesdale]] draught horses were needed to haul the centre anchor by wagon from the [[N. Hingley & Sons Ltd|Noah Hingley & Sons Ltd]] forge shop in Netherton, near Dudley, United Kingdom to the Dudley railway station two miles away. From there it was shipped by rail to Fleetwood in Lancashire before being loaded aboard a ship and sent to Belfast.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-the-hingley-anchors.html|title=Titanic: The Hingley Anchors|first=Jonathan|last=Smith|journal=Encyclopedia Titanica |date=11 September 2012|access-date=28 February 2015|archive-date=25 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180625185849/https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-the-hingley-anchors.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

The work of constructing the ships was difficult and dangerous. For the 15,000 men who worked at Harland and Wolff at the time,{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=105}} safety precautions were rudimentary at best; a lot of the work was carried out without equipment like hard hats or hand guards on machinery. As a result, during ''Titanic''{{'}}s construction, 246 injuries were recorded, 28 of them "severe", such as arms severed by machines or legs crushed under falling pieces of steel. Six people died on the ship herself while she was being constructed and fitted out, and another two died in the shipyard workshops and sheds.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=109}} Just before the launch a worker was killed when a piece of wood fell on him.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=33}}

''Titanic'' was launched at 12:15&nbsp;pm on 31 May 1911 in the presence of Lord Pirrie, J. Pierpont Morgan, J. Bruce Ismay and 100,000 onlookers.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=15}}<ref>[https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn88064469/1911-06-06/ed-1/seq-4/#date1=1911&sort=relevance&rows=20&words=Titanic&searchType=basic&sequence=0&index=19&state=&date2=1911&protext=Titanic&y=0&x=0&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=4 The Caucasian] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210106102950/https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn88064469/1911-06-06/ed-1/seq-4/#date1=1911&sort=relevance&rows=20&words=Titanic&searchType=basic&sequence=0&index=19&state=&date2=1911&protext=Titanic&y=0&x=0&dateFilterType=yearRange&page=4 |date=6 January 2021 }}, (newspaper of Shreveport, Louisiana) 6 June 1911...Retrieved 4 October 2018</ref> Twenty-two tons of soap and [[tallow]] were spread on the slipway to lubricate the ship's passage into the [[River Lagan]].{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=33}} In keeping with the White Star Line's traditional policy, the ship was not formally named or christened with champagne.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=15}} The ship was towed to a fitting-out berth where, over the course of the next year, her engines, funnels and superstructure were installed and her interior was fitted out.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=18}}

Although ''Titanic'' was virtually identical to the class's lead ship ''Olympic'', a few changes were made to distinguish both ships. The most noticeable exterior difference was that ''Titanic'' (and the third vessel in class, {{HMHS|Britannic||2}}) had a steel screen with sliding windows installed along the forward half of the A Deck promenade. This was installed as a last-minute change at the personal request of Bruce Ismay and was intended to provide additional shelter to First Class passengers.<ref name="Marriott"/> Extensive changes were made to B Deck on ''Titanic'' as the promenade space in this deck, which had proven unpopular on ''Olympic'', was converted into additional First-Class cabins, including two opulent parlour suites with their own private promenade spaces. The ''À la Carte'' restaurant was also enlarged and the ''Café Parisien'', an entirely new feature which did not exist on ''Olympic'', was added. These changes made ''Titanic'' slightly heavier than her sister, and thus she could claim to be the largest ship afloat. The work took longer than expected due to design changes requested by Ismay and a temporary pause in work occasioned by the need to repair ''Olympic'', which had been in a collision in September 1911. Had ''Titanic'' been finished earlier, she might well have missed her collision with an iceberg.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=33}}

=== Sea trials ===
[[File:RMS Titanic 2.jpg|thumb|''Titanic'' departing [[Belfast]] for sea trials on 2 April 1912]]
''Titanic''{{'}}s sea trials began at 6&nbsp;am on Tuesday, 2 April 1912, just two days after her fitting out was finished and eight days before she was due to leave Southampton on her maiden voyage.{{sfn|Spignesi|1998|p=22}} The trials were delayed for a day due to bad weather, but by Monday morning it was clear and fair.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=44}} Aboard were 78 stokers, greasers and firemen, and 41 members of crew. No domestic staff appear to have been aboard. Representatives of various companies travelled on ''Titanic''{{'}}s sea trials: Thomas Andrews and Edward Wilding of Harland and Wolff, and Harold A. Sanderson of IMM. Bruce Ismay and Lord Pirrie were too ill to attend. [[Jack Phillips (wireless officer)|Jack Phillips]] and [[Harold Bride]] served as radio operators and performed fine-tuning of the Marconi equipment. Francis Carruthers, a surveyor from the Board of Trade, was also present to see that everything worked and that the ship was fit to carry passengers.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|pp=44, 46}}

The sea trials consisted of a number of tests of her handling characteristics, carried out first in [[Belfast Lough]] and then in the open waters of the [[Irish Sea]]. Over the course of about 12 hours, ''Titanic'' was driven at different speeds, her turning ability was tested and a "crash stop" was performed in which the engines were reversed full ahead to full astern, bringing her to a stop in {{convert|850|yards|m|0|abbr=on}} or 3 minutes and 15 seconds.{{sfn|Chirnside|2004|pp=39–40}} The ship covered a distance of about {{convert|80|nmi|mi km}}, averaging {{convert|18|kn|mph km/h}} and reaching a maximum speed of just under {{convert|21|kn|mph km/h}}.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=45}}

On returning to Belfast at about 7&nbsp;pm, the surveyor signed an "Agreement and Account of Voyages and Crew", valid for 12 months, which declared the ship seaworthy. An hour later, ''Titanic'' departed Belfast to head to Southampton, a voyage of about {{convert|570|nmi|mi km}}. After a journey lasting about 28 hours, she arrived about midnight on 4 April and was towed to the port's Berth 44, ready for the arrival of her passengers and the remainder of her crew.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=46}}

Both ''Olympic'' and ''Titanic'' registered [[Liverpool]] as their home port. The offices of the White Star Line, as well as Cunard, were in Liverpool, and up until the introduction of the ''Olympic'', most British ocean liners for both Cunard and White Star, such as ''Lusitania'' and ''Mauretania'', sailed from Liverpool followed by a port of call in [[Queenstown, Ireland]]. Since the company's founding in 1845, a vast majority of their operations had taken place from Liverpool. However, in 1907 White Star Line established another service from Southampton on England's south coast, which became known as White Star's "Express Service". Southampton had many advantages over Liverpool, the first being its proximity to London.{{sfn|McCluskie|1998|p=21}}

In addition, Southampton, being on the south coast, allowed ships to easily cross the [[English Channel]] and make a port of call on the northern coast of France, usually at [[Cherbourg]]. This allowed British ships to pick up clientele from continental Europe before recrossing the channel and picking up passengers at Queenstown. The Southampton-Cherbourg-New York run would become so popular that most British ocean liners began using the port after [[World War I]]. Out of respect for Liverpool, ships continued to be registered there until the early 1960s. ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2]]'' was one of the first ships registered in Southampton when introduced into service by Cunard in 1969.{{sfn|McCluskie|1998|p=21}}

''Titanic''{{'}}s maiden voyage was intended to be the first of many trans-Atlantic crossings between Southampton and New York via Cherbourg and Queenstown on westbound runs, returning via [[Plymouth]] in England while eastbound. Indeed, her entire schedule of voyages through to December 1912 still exists.<ref>Eaton and Haas; ''The Misadventures of the White Star Line'', c. 1990</ref> When the route was established, four ships were assigned to the service. In addition to ''Teutonic'' and ''Majestic'', {{RMS|Oceanic|1899|6}} and the brand new {{RMS|Adriatic|1907|6}} sailed the route. When the ''Olympic'' entered service in June 1911, she replaced ''Teutonic'', which after completing her last run on the service in late April was transferred to the Dominion Line's Canadian service. The following August, ''Adriatic'' was transferred to White Star Line's main Liverpool-New York service, and in November, ''Majestic'' was withdrawn from service impending the arrival of ''Titanic'' in the coming months and was mothballed as a reserve ship.<ref>De Kerbrech, Richard, "Ships of the White Star Line", pp. 50, 53, 112</ref><ref name="Leaflet"/>

White Star Line's initial plans for ''Olympic'' and ''Titanic'' on the Southampton run followed the same routine as their predecessors had done before them. Each would sail once every three weeks from Southampton and New York, usually leaving at noon each Wednesday from Southampton and each Saturday from New York, thus enabling the White Star Line to offer weekly sailings in each direction. Special trains were scheduled from London and Paris to convey passengers to Southampton and Cherbourg respectively.<ref name="Leaflet"/> The deep-water dock at Southampton, then known as the "''White Star Dock''{{-"}}, had been specially constructed to accommodate the new ''Olympic''-class liners, and had opened in 1911.<ref>{{cite web|title=Southampton in 1912 |url=http://www.southampton.gov.uk/s-leisure/artsheritage/history/titanic/exhibitions/southampton1912.aspx |publisher=Southampton City Council |access-date=1 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122005156/http://www.southampton.gov.uk/s-leisure/artsheritage/history/titanic/exhibitions/southampton1912.aspx |archive-date=22 January 2012 }}</ref>

=== Crew ===
{{main|Crew of the Titanic|l1=Crew of ''Titanic''}}
[[File:EJ Smith.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edward Smith (sea captain)|Edward Smith]], captain of ''Titanic'', in 1911]]
''Titanic'' had around 885 crew members on board for her maiden voyage.{{sfn|Mersey|1912|pp=110–111}} Like other vessels of her time, she did not have a permanent crew, and the vast majority of crew members were casual workers who only came aboard the ship a few hours before she sailed from Southampton.{{sfn|Barratt|2009|p=84}} The process of signing up recruits had begun on 23 March and some had been sent to Belfast, where they served as a skeleton crew during ''Titanic''{{'}}s sea trials and passage to England at the start of April.{{sfn|Barratt|2009|p=83}}

Captain [[Edward Smith (sea captain)|Edward John Smith]], the most senior of the White Star Line's captains, was transferred from ''Olympic'' to take command of ''Titanic''.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|pp=43–44}} [[Henry Tingle Wilde]] also came across from ''Olympic'' to take the post of [[chief mate]]. ''Titanic''{{'}}s previously designated chief mate and first officer, [[William McMaster Murdoch]] and [[Charles Lightoller]], were bumped down to the ranks of first and second officer respectively. The original second officer, [[David Blair (mariner)|David Blair]], was dropped altogether.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=241}}{{efn|He expressed deep disappointment about the decision before the voyage but was presumably greatly relieved afterwards.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=241}}}} The [[Third mate|third officer]] was [[Herbert Pitman]], the only deck officer who was not a member of the [[Royal Naval Reserve]]. Pitman was the second-to-last surviving officer.

''Titanic''{{'}}s crew were divided into three principal departments: Deck, with 66 crew; Engine, with 325; and Victualling, with 494.{{sfn|Barratt|2009|p=92}} The vast majority of the crew were thus not seamen but were either engineers, firemen, or stokers, responsible for looking after the engines, or stewards and galley staff, responsible for the passengers.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=238}} Of these, over 97% were male; just 23 of the crew were female, mainly stewardesses.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=242}} The rest represented a great variety of professions—bakers, chefs, butchers, fishmongers, dishwashers, stewards, gymnasium instructors, laundrymen, waiters, bed-makers, cleaners, and even a printer,{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=242}} who produced a daily newspaper for passengers called the ''Atlantic Daily Bulletin'' with the latest news received by the ship's wireless operators.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=162}}{{efn|''Titanic'' also had a ship's cat, [[Animals aboard the Titanic#Jenny|Jenny]], who gave birth to a litter of kittens shortly before the ship's maiden voyage; all perished in the sinking.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=246}}}}

Most of the crew signed on in Southampton on 6 April;{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=56}} in all, 699 of the crew came from there, and 40% were natives of the town.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=242}} A few specialist staff were self-employed or were subcontractors. These included the five postal clerks, who worked for the Royal Mail and the United States Post Office Department, the staff of the First Class ''À La Carte'' Restaurant and the Café Parisien, the radio operators (who were employed by Marconi) and the [[Musicians of the Titanic|eight musicians]], who were employed by an agency and travelled as second-class passengers.{{sfn|Barratt|2009|p=50}} Crew pay varied greatly, from Captain Smith's £105 a month (equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|105|1912|r=-2}}}} today) to the £3 10''[[Shilling (British coin)|s]]'' (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|3.5|1912|r=-1}}}} today) that stewardesses earned. The lower-paid victualling staff could, however, supplement their wages substantially through tips from passengers.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=246}}

=== Passengers ===
{{main|Passengers of the Titanic|l1=Passengers of ''Titanic''}}

[[File:John Jacob Astor 1909.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Jacob Astor IV]] in 1909. He was the wealthiest person aboard ''Titanic''; he did not survive.|left]]
''Titanic''{{'}}s passengers numbered approximately 1,317 people: 324 in First Class, 284 in Second Class, and 709 in Third Class. Of these, 869 (66%) were male and 447 (34%) female. There were 107 children aboard, the largest number of whom were in Third Class.{{sfn|Barratt|2009|p=93}} The ship was considerably under-capacity on her maiden voyage, as she could accommodate 2,453 passengers—833 First Class, 614 Second Class, and 1,006 Third Class.{{sfn|Howells|1999|p=18}}

Usually, a high-prestige vessel like ''Titanic'' could expect to be fully booked on its maiden voyage. However, a [[National coal strike of 1912|national coal strike]] in the UK had caused considerable disruption to shipping schedules in the spring of 1912, causing many crossings to be cancelled. Many would-be passengers chose to postpone their travel plans until the strike was over. The strike had finished a few days before ''Titanic'' sailed; however, that was too late to have much of an effect. ''Titanic'' was able to sail on the scheduled date only because coal was transferred from other vessels which were tied up at Southampton, such as {{SS|City of New York}} and {{RMS|Oceanic|1899|6}}, as well as coal that ''Olympic'' had brought back from a previous voyage to New York, which had been stored at the White Star Dock.<ref name="Marriott"/>

Some of the most prominent people of the day booked a passage aboard ''Titanic'', travelling in First Class. Among them (with those who perished marked with a dagger†) were the American millionaire [[John Jacob Astor IV]]† and his wife, [[Madeleine Astor|Madeleine Force Astor]] (with [[John Jacob Astor VI]] in utero); industrialist [[Benjamin Guggenheim]]†; painter and sculptor [[Francis Davis Millet]]†; [[Macy's]] owner [[Isidor Straus]]† and his wife, [[Ida Straus|Ida]]†; [[Denver]] millionairess [[Margaret Brown|Margaret "Molly" Brown]];{{efn|Known afterward as the "Unsinkable Molly Brown" due to her efforts in helping other passengers while the ship sank.}} Sir [[Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon, 5th Baronet|Cosmo Duff Gordon]] and his wife, [[couturière]] [[Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon|Lucy (Lady Duff-Gordon)]]; Lieut.

''Titanic''{{'}}s owner [[J. P.

The exact number of people aboard is not known, as not all of those who had booked tickets made it to the ship; about 50 people cancelled for various reasons,{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=73}} and not all of those who boarded stayed aboard for the entire journey.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://historyonthenet.com/Titanic/passengers.htm |title=Titanic—Passenger and Crew statistics |publisher=Historyonthenet.com |access-date=8 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406052631/http://www.historyonthenet.com/Titanic/passengers.htm |archive-date=6 April 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Fares varied depending on class and season.

=== Collecting passengers ===
''Titanic''{{'}}s maiden voyage began on Wednesday, 10 April 1912. Following the embarkation of the crew, the passengers began arriving at 9:30&nbsp;am, when the [[London and South Western Railway]]'s boat train from [[London Waterloo station]] reached [[Southampton Terminus railway station]] on the quayside, alongside ''Titanic''{{'}}s berth.{{sfn|Barratt|2009|p=61}} The large number of Third Class passengers meant they were the first to board, with First and Second Class passengers following up to an hour before departure. Stewards showed them to their cabins, and First Class passengers were personally greeted by Captain Smith.{{sfn|Gill|2010|p=252}} Third Class passengers were inspected for ailments and physical impairments that might lead to their being refused entry to the United States – a prospect the White Star Line wished to avoid, as it would have to carry anyone who failed the examination back across the Atlantic.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=73}} In all, 920 passengers boarded ''Titanic'' at Southampton – 179 First Class, 247 Second Class, and 494 Third Class. Additional passengers were to be picked up at [[Cherbourg]] and Queenstown.<ref name="Marriott">{{cite book|last=Marriott|first=Leo|title=Titanic |year=1997|publisher=PRC Publishing Ltd|isbn=978-1-85648-433-6}}</ref>
[[File:Titanic avoiding collision in Southampton.jpg|thumb|S.S. New York breaking free of her moorings in Southampton. RMS Oceanic is to her left.]]
The maiden voyage began at noon, as scheduled. An accident was narrowly averted only a few minutes later, as ''Titanic'' passed the moored liners {{SS|City of New York}} of the [[American Line]] and ''[[RMS Oceanic (1899)|Oceanic]]'' of the White Star Line, the latter of which would have been her running mate on the service from Southampton. Her huge [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]] caused both of the smaller ships to be lifted by a bulge of water and then dropped into a trough. ''New York''{{'}}s mooring cables could not take the sudden strain and snapped, swinging her around stern-first towards ''Titanic''. A nearby tugboat, ''Vulcan'', came to the rescue by taking ''New York'' under tow, and Captain Smith ordered ''Titanic''{{'}}s engines to be put "full astern".{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=76}} The two ships avoided a collision by a distance of about {{convert|4|ft|m}}. The incident delayed ''Titanic''{{'}}s departure for about an hour, while the drifting ''New York'' was brought under control.{{sfn|Brewster|Coulter|1998|p=22}}<ref name="nyt19120411">{{cite news |title=TITANIC IN PERIL ON LEAVING PORT; Suction of Giant Liner Breaks Hawsers of the New York, Which Floats Helpless. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1912/04/11/archives/titanic-in-peril-on-leaving-port-suction-of-giant-liner-breaks.html |access-date=22 March 2022 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=11 April 1912 |page=1}}</ref>

After making it safely through the complex tides and channels of [[Southampton Water]] and the [[Solent]], ''Titanic'' disembarked the Southampton [[Maritime pilot|pilot]] at the [[Nab Tower|Nab Lightship]] and headed out into the [[English Channel]].<ref>[{{GBurl|id=GRbbn6mquSwC|q=the+maiden+voyage+george+bowyer|p=81}} ''A Cold Night in the Atlantic''] pgs.81–82 by Kevin Wright Carney c.2008 {{ISBN|978-1-9350-2802-4}} (hard cover)</ref> She headed for the French port of Cherbourg, a journey of {{convert|77|nmi|mi km}}.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=71}} The weather was windy, very fine but cold and overcast.{{sfn|Halpern|2011|p=79}} Because Cherbourg lacked docking facilities for a ship the size of ''Titanic'', [[Ship's tender|tenders]] had to be used to transfer passengers from shore to ship. The White Star Line operated two at Cherbourg, {{SS|Traffic|1911|6}} and {{SS|Nomadic|1911|6}}, (''Nomadic'' being the only surviving White Star Line ship). Both had been designed specifically as tenders for the ''Olympic''-class liners and were launched shortly after ''Titanic''.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=92}} Four hours after ''Titanic'' left Southampton, she arrived at Cherbourg and was met by the tenders. There, 274 additional passengers were taken aboard – 142 First Class, 30 Second Class, and 102 Third Class. Twenty-four passengers left aboard the tenders to be conveyed to shore, having booked only a cross-Channel passage. The process was completed within only 90 minutes and at 8&nbsp;pm ''Titanic'' [[Weigh anchor|weighed anchor]] and left for Queenstown{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=93}} with the weather continuing cold and windy.{{sfn|Halpern|2011|p=79}}
[[File:Nomadic.jpg|thumb|The tender "Nomadic"]]
At 11:30&nbsp;am on Thursday 11 April, ''Titanic'' arrived at [[Cork Harbour]] on the south coast of Ireland. It was a partly cloudy but relatively warm day, with a brisk wind.{{sfn|Halpern|2011|p=79}} Again, the dock facilities were not suitable for a ship of ''Titanic''{{'s}} size, and the tenders ''America'' and ''Ireland'' were used to bring passengers aboard. In all, 123 passengers boarded ''Titanic'' at Queenstown – three First Class, seven Second Class and 113 Third Class. In addition to the 24 cross-Channel passengers who had disembarked at Cherbourg, another seven passengers had booked an overnight passage from Southampton to Queenstown. Among the seven was [[Francis Browne]], a [[Jesuit]] trainee who was a keen photographer and took many photographs aboard ''Titanic'', including one of the last known photographs of the ship. The very last one was taken by another cross-channel passenger, Kate Odell.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Klistorner |first1=Daniel |last2=Hall |first2=Steve |last3=Beveridge |first3=Bruce |last4=Andrews |first4=Scott |last5=Braunschweiger |first5=Art |title=Titanic in Photographs |page=6|date=2013 |publisher=History Press Limited |isbn=978-0-7524-9953-6 |url={{GBurl|id=Z9o6mwEACAAJ}}}}</ref> A decidedly unofficial departure was that of a crew member, stoker John Coffey, a Queenstown native who sneaked off the ship by hiding under mail bags being transported to shore.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=100}} ''Titanic'' weighed anchor for the last time at 1:30&nbsp;pm and departed on her westward journey across the Atlantic.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=100}}

''Titanic'' received a series of warnings from other ships of drifting ice in the area of the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]], but Captain Smith ignored them.{{sfn|Ryan|1985|p=9}} One of the ships to warn ''Titanic'' was the Atlantic Line's {{SS|Mesaba|1898|2}}.<ref name=HW319>{{cite web |title=Winifreda |url=http://www.theyard.info/ships/ships.asp?entryid=319 |url-status=live |publisher=The Yard |access-date=21 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222110112/http://www.theyard.info/ships/ships.asp?entryid=319 |archive-date=22 February 2017}}</ref> Nevertheless, ''Titanic'' continued to steam at full speed, which was standard practice at the time.{{sfn|Mowbray|1912|p=278}} Although she was not trying to set a speed record,{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=24}} timekeeping was a priority, and under prevailing maritime practices, ships were often operated at close to full speed; ice warnings were seen as advisories, and reliance was placed upon lookouts and the watch on the bridge.{{sfn|Mowbray|1912|p=278}} It was generally believed that ice posed little danger to large vessels. Close calls with ice were not uncommon, and even head-on collisions had not been disastrous. In 1907, {{SS|Kronprinz Wilhelm}}, a German liner, had rammed an iceberg but still completed her voyage, and Smith said in 1907 that he "could not imagine any condition which would cause a ship to founder.

At 11:40&nbsp;pm ([[ship's time]]) on 14 April, lookout [[Frederick Fleet]] spotted an iceberg immediately ahead of ''Titanic'' and alerted the bridge.{{sfn|Lord|2005|p=2}} [[Chief mate|First Officer]] [[William McMaster Murdoch|William Murdoch]] ordered the ship to be steered around the iceberg and the engines to be reversed,{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=191}} but it was too late. The starboard side of ''Titanic'' struck the iceberg, creating a series of holes below the waterline.{{efn|The official enquiry found that damage extended about 300 feet, but both Edward Wilding's testimony and modern [[ultrasound]] surveys of the [[Wreck of the RMS Titanic|wreck]] suggest the total area was perhaps a few narrow openings totalling perhaps no more than {{convert|12|to|13|sqft|m2|1}}.{{sfn|Report|1912|p=question 20422, Day 19}}{{sfn|Broad|1997}}}} The [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] was not punctured, but rather dented such that the steel plates of the hull buckled and separated, allowing water to rush in. Five of the sixteen watertight compartments were heavily breached. A sixth compartment, Boiler Room 5, was also slightly compromised, however its flooding was contained to its forward starboard coal bunker for some time with the assistance of the pumps. It soon became clear that ''Titanic'' would sink, as she could not remain afloat with more than four compartments flooded. She began sinking bow-first, with water spilling from compartment to compartment over the top of each watertight bulkhead as her angle in the water became steeper.{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=22}}
[[File:Titanic-sinking.png|thumb|Diagrams explaining the Titanic's breakup.]]
Those aboard ''Titanic'' were ill-prepared for such an emergency. In accordance with accepted practices of the time, as ships were seen as largely unsinkable and lifeboats were intended to transfer passengers to nearby rescue vessels,{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=116}}{{efn|An incident confirmed this philosophy while ''Titanic'' was under construction: the White Star liner ''Republic'' was involved in a collision and sank. Even though she did not have enough lifeboats for all passengers, they were all saved because the ship was able to stay afloat long enough for them to be ferried to ships coming to assist.{{sfn|Chirnside|2004|p=29}}}} ''Titanic'' only had enough lifeboats to carry about half of those on board; if the ship had carried her full complement of about 3,339 passengers and crew, only about a third could have been accommodated in the lifeboats.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=109}} The crew had not been trained adequately in carrying out an evacuation. The officers did not know how many they could safely put aboard the lifeboats and launched many of them barely half-full.{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=21}} Third-class passengers were largely left to fend for themselves, causing many of them to become trapped below decks as the ship filled with water.{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=284}} The "[[women and children first]]" protocol was generally followed when loading the lifeboats,{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=284}} and most of the male passengers and crew were left aboard. Women and children survived at rates of about 75 percent and 50 percent, while only 20 percent of men survived.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://courses.bowdoin.edu/history-2203-fall-2020-kmoyniha/reflection/#:~:text=Women%20and%20children%20survived%20at,passengers%20was%20not%20necessarily%20surprising | title=Disproportionate Devastation &#124; Titanic }}</ref>

Between 2:10 and 2:15&nbsp;am, a little over two and a half hours after ''Titanic'' struck the iceberg, her rate of sinking suddenly increased as the boat deck dipped underwater, and the sea poured in through open hatches and grates.{{sfn|Halpern|Weeks|2011|p=118}} As her unsupported stern rose out of the water, exposing the propellers, the ship broke in two main pieces between the second and third funnels, due to the immense forces on the keel. With the bow underwater, and air trapped in the stern, the stern remained afloat and buoyant for a few minutes longer, rising to a nearly vertical angle with hundreds of people still clinging to it,{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=29}} before foundering at 2:20&nbsp;am.{{sfn|Barratt|2009|p=131}} It was believed that ''Titanic'' sank in one piece, but the discovery of [[Wreck of the RMS Titanic|the wreck]] many years later revealed that she had broken in two. All remaining passengers and crew were immersed in water at a temperature of {{convert|-2|°C|0|abbr=on}}.  Only five who were in the water were helped into the lifeboats, though the lifeboats had room for almost 500 more people.{{sfn|Lord|2005|p=103}}

Distress signals were sent by wireless, rockets, and lamp, but none of the ships that responded were near enough to reach ''Titanic'' before she sank.{{sfn|Brewster|Coulter|1998|pp=45–47}} A radio operator on board {{SS|Birma}}, for instance, estimated that it would be 6&nbsp;am before the liner could arrive at the scene. Meanwhile, {{SS|Californian}}, which was the last to have been in contact before the collision, saw ''Titanic''{{'}}s flares but failed to assist.{{sfn|Brewster|Coulter|1998|pp=64–65}} Around 4&nbsp;am, {{RMS|Carpathia}} arrived on the scene in response to ''Titanic''{{'}}s earlier distress calls.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=238}}

In Lifeboat No. 2, Fourth Officer Boxhall lit several green [[Roman candle (firework)|roman candles]], signaling ''Carpathia'' to make her way towards them. The ship pulled alongside No. 2, where a woman in the boat cried "''Titanic'' has gone down with everyone aboard!" Boxhall quickly replied with "Shut up, lady!" Boxhall later apologized for his outburst, but both people involved agreed that it was acceptable, given the circumstances they had just endured and their current conditions.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lord |first=Walter |title=A Night to Remember |date=November 1955 |publisher=Holt Paperback |year=1955}}</ref>

One by one, ''Titanic''<nowiki/>'s lifeboats were picked up by ''Carpathia''. Passengers from Collapsibles A and B were transferred into other boats and ferried to ''Carpathia''. Collapsible C was towed by Lifeboat 14 to ''Carpathia'', where Fifth Officer Lowe rigged up a sail. When asked how he knew, Lowe replied "Not all sailors are seamen, and not all seamen are sailors."

When the ship sank, the lifeboats that had been lowered were only filled up to an average of 60%.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Titanic (ship) {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/video/194837/overview-Titanic |access-date=2023-02-24 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref> 706 people survived the disaster and were conveyed by ''Carpathia'' to New York, ''Titanic''{{'s}} original destination, while 1,517 people died.{{sfn|Mersey|1912|pp=110–111}} ''Carpathia''{{'s}} captain described the place as an ice field that had included 20 large bergs measuring up to {{convert|200|ft|m}} high and numerous smaller bergs, as well as ice floes and debris from ''Titanic''; passengers described being in the middle of a vast white plain of ice, studded with icebergs.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|pp=242, 245}} This area is now known as [[Iceberg Alley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthsky.org/earth/a-trip-down-canadas-iceberg-alley|title=A trip down Canada's Iceberg Alley – EarthSky.org|website=earthsky.org|date=22 August 2014|access-date=9 February 2017|archive-date=27 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627204001/http://earthsky.org/earth/a-trip-down-canadas-iceberg-alley|url-status=live}}</ref>

''Carpathia'' docked at 9:30&nbsp;pm on 18 April at New York's [[Pier 54]] and was greeted by some 40,000 people waiting at the quayside in heavy rain.{{sfn|Butler|2002|pp=170, 172}} Immediate relief in the form of clothing and transportation to shelters was provided by the Women's Relief Committee, the [[Travelers Aid Society of New York]], and the [[National Council of Jewish Women|Council of Jewish Women]], among other organisations.{{sfn|Landau|2001|pp=22–23}} Many of ''Titanic''{{'}}s surviving passengers did not linger in New York but headed onwards immediately to relatives' homes.

''Titanic''{{'}}s 214 surviving crew members were taken to the [[Red Star Line]]'s steamer {{SS|Lapland}}, where they were accommodated in passenger cabins.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=183}}

''Carpathia'' was hurriedly restocked with food and provisions before resuming her journey to [[Rijeka|Fiume]], [[Austria-Hungary]].

The ship's arrival in New York led to a frenzy of press interest, with newspapers competing to be the first to report the survivors' stories.

In January 1912, the hulls and equipment of ''Titanic'' and ''Olympic'' had been insured through [[Lloyd's of London]] and London Marine Insurance. The total coverage was £1,000,000 (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK-GDP|1000000|1912|r=-6}}}} today) per ship. The policy was to be "free from all average" under £150,000, meaning that the insurers would only pay for damage in excess of that sum. The premium, negotiated by brokers Willis Faber & Company (now [[Willis Group]]), was 15 ''s'' (75 ''p'') per £100, or £7,500 (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|7500|1912|r=-4}}}} today) for the term of one year.

Many charities were set up to help the survivors and their families, many of whom lost their sole [[wage earner]], or, in the case of many Third-Class survivors, everything they owned.

The settlement was agreed to by 44 of the claimants in December 1915, with $500,000 set aside for the American claimants, $50,000 for the British, and $114,000 to go towards interest and legal expenses.<ref name="Fort Wayne">{{cite news| url=https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-owners-settle.html| title=Titanic Owners Offer to Settle for $664,000| publisher=Fort Wayne Gazette| date=18 December 1915| access-date=14 August 2018| archive-date=6 January 2021| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210106103040/https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-owners-settle.html| url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="NY Times">{{cite news| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1915/12/18/170357322.pdf| title=Titanic Claimants to Accept $664,000; Tentative Settlement Reached by Lawyers Representing Both Sides.

Even before the survivors arrived in New York, investigations were being planned to discover what had happened, and what could be done to prevent a recurrence. Inquiries were held in both the United States and the United Kingdom, the former more robustly critical of traditions and practices, and scathing of the failures involved, and the latter broadly more technical and expert-orientated.{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|pp=70–1}}

The [[United States Senate inquiry into the sinking of the RMS Titanic|US Senate's inquiry into the disaster]] was initiated on 19 April, a day after ''Carpathia'' arrived in New York.{{sfn|Brewster|Coulter|1998|p=72}} The chairman, Senator [[William Alden Smith]], wanted to gather accounts from passengers and crew while the events were still fresh in their minds. Smith also needed to subpoena all surviving British passengers and crew while they were still on American soil, which prevented them from returning to the UK before the American inquiry was completed on 25 May.<ref name="Senate"/> The British press condemned Smith as an opportunist, insensitively forcing an inquiry as a means of gaining political prestige and seizing "his moment to stand on the world stage". Smith, however, already had a reputation as a campaigner for safety on US railroads, and wanted to investigate any possible malpractices by railroad tycoon J. P. Morgan, ''Titanic''{{'}}s ultimate owner.{{sfn|Butler|1998|pp=180–186}}

The [[British Wreck Commissioner's inquiry into the sinking of the RMS Titanic|British Board of Trade's inquiry into the disaster]] was headed by [[John Bigham, 1st Viscount Mersey|Lord Mersey]], and took place between 2 May and 3 July. Being run by the Board of Trade, who had previously approved the ship, it was seen by some{{Like whom?|date=June 2020}} as having little interest in its own or White Star's conduct being found negligent.{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|pp=70–71, 182}}

Each inquiry took testimony from both passengers and crew of ''Titanic'', crew members of Leyland Line's ''Californian'', Captain [[Arthur Rostron]] of ''Carpathia'' and other experts.{{sfn|Butler|1998|pp=192–194}} The British inquiry also took far greater expert testimony, making it the longest and most detailed court of inquiry in British history up to that time.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=194}} The two inquiries reached broadly similar conclusions: the regulations on the number of lifeboats that ships had to carry were out of date and inadequate,{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=195}} Captain Smith had failed to take proper heed of ice warnings,{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=189}} the lifeboats had not been properly filled or crewed, and the collision was the direct result of steaming into a dangerous area at too high a speed.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=195}}

Neither inquiry's findings listed negligence by IMM or the White Star Line as a factor. The American inquiry concluded that since those involved had followed standard practice, the disaster was an [[act of God]].{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=67}} The British inquiry concluded that Smith had followed long-standing practice that had not previously been shown to be unsafe,{{sfn|Lynch|1992|p=189}} noting that British ships alone had carried 3.5&nbsp;million passengers over the previous decade with the loss of just 10 lives,{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=265}} and concluded that Smith had done "only that which other skilled men would have done in the same position". Lord Mersey did, however, find fault with the "extremely high speed (twenty-two knots) which was maintained" following numerous ice warnings,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Lord Mersey's Report on the Loss of the "Titanic"|journal=Nature|date=25 April 1912|volume=89|issue=2232|pages=581–584|doi=10.1038/089581d0|issn=0028-0836|bibcode=1912Natur..89..581.|doi-access=free}}</ref> noting that "what was a mistake in the case of the ''Titanic'' would without doubt be negligence in any similar case in the future".{{sfn|Lynch|1992|p=189}}

The recommendations included strong suggestions for major changes in maritime regulations to implement new safety measures, such as ensuring that more lifeboats were provided, that lifeboat drills were properly carried out and that wireless equipment on passenger ships was manned around the clock.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=223}} An [[International Ice Patrol]] was set up to monitor the presence of icebergs in the North Atlantic, and maritime safety regulations were harmonised internationally through the [[International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea]]; both measures are still in force today.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=310}}

On 18 June 1912, [[Guglielmo Marconi]] gave evidence to the Court of Inquiry regarding the telegraphy. Its final report recommended that all liners carry the system and that sufficient operators maintain a constant service.<ref>Court of Inquiry ''Loss of the S.S. Titanic'' 1912</ref>

The way in which the ''Titanic'' sank brought to light serious design issues with the ''Olympic''-class. This resulted in the ''Olympic'' receiving a major refit and major design changes for the construction of the ''Britannic''.<ref>Archibald, Rick & Ballard, Robert. "The Lost Ships of Robert Ballard," Thunder Bay Press: 2005; 100.</ref>

In August 1912, the liner ''Corsican'' also struck an iceberg in the Atlantic, severely damaging her bow; however due to the weather being hazy at the time, her speed had been reduced to 'dead slow', so limiting further damage. Although the lifeboats had been swung out, they were not boarded.<ref>Liner Strikes An Iceberg, Western Mail, 22 August 1912, p5</ref>

==== Role of SS ''Californian'' ====
[[File:Californian.jpg|thumb|SS ''Californian'', which had tried to warn ''Titanic'' of the danger from pack-ice]]

One of the most controversial issues examined by the inquiries was the role played by {{SS|Californian}}, which had been only a few miles from ''Titanic'' but had not picked up her distress calls or responded to her signal rockets. ''Californian'' had stopped for the night because of icy conditions and warned ''Titanic'' by radio, but was rebuked by ''Titanic''{{'}}s senior wireless operator, [[Jack Phillips (wireless officer)|Jack Phillips]].{{sfn|Butler|2002|p=160}}

Testimony before the British inquiry revealed that at 10:10&nbsp;pm, ''Californian'' observed the lights of a ship to the south; it was later agreed between Captain [[Stanley Lord]] and Third Officer C.V. Groves (who had relieved Lord of duty at 11:10&nbsp;pm) that this was a passenger liner.{{sfn|Butler|2002|p=160}} At 11:50&nbsp;pm, the officer had watched that ship's lights flash out, as if she had shut down or turned sharply, and that the port light was now visible.{{sfn|Butler|2002|p=160}} Morse light signals to the ship, upon Lord's order, were made between 11:30&nbsp;pm and 1:00&nbsp;am, but were not acknowledged.{{sfn|Butler|2002|p=161}} If ''Titanic'' was as far from the ''Californian'' as Lord claimed, then he knew, or should have known, that Morse signals would not be visible. A reasonable and prudent course of action would have been to awaken the wireless operator and to instruct him to attempt to contact ''Titanic'' by that method. Had Lord done so, it is possible he could have reached ''Titanic'' in time to save additional lives.<ref name=wsj1/>

Captain Lord had gone to the chartroom at 11:00&nbsp;pm to spend the night;{{sfn|Butler|2002|p=159}} however, Second Officer Herbert Stone, now on duty, notified Lord at 1:10&nbsp;am that the ship had fired five rockets. Lord wanted to know if they were company signals, that is, coloured flares used for identification. Stone said that he did not know and that the rockets were all white.{{Clarify|reason=what is the significance of white vs. coloured?|date=June 2022}} Captain Lord instructed the crew to continue to signal the other vessel with the Morse lamp, and went back to sleep. Three more rockets were observed at 1:50&nbsp;am and Stone noted that the ship looked strange in the water, as if she were [[Angle of list|listing]]. At 2:15&nbsp;am, Lord was notified that the ship could no longer be seen. Lord asked again if the lights had had any colours in them, and he was informed that they were all white.{{sfn|Chirnside|2004|p=344}}

''Californian'' eventually responded. At around 5:30&nbsp;am, Chief Officer George Stewart awakened wireless operator [[Cyril Furmstone Evans]], informed him that rockets had been seen during the night, and asked that he try to communicate with any ship. He got news of ''Titanic''{{'}}s loss, Captain Lord was notified, and the ship set out to render assistance. She arrived well after ''Carpathia'' had already picked up all the survivors.{{sfn|Butler|2002|pp=164–165}}

The inquiries found that the ship seen by ''Californian'' was in fact ''Titanic'' and that it would have been possible for ''Californian'' to come to her rescue; therefore, Captain Lord had acted improperly in failing to do so.{{sfn|Butler|2002|pp=191, 196}}{{efn| Lord protested his innocence to the end of his life, and many researchers have asserted that the known positions of ''Titanic'' and ''Californian'' make it impossible that the former was the infamous "mystery ship", a topic which has "generated ... millions of words and ... hours of heated debates" and continues to do so.<ref>{{cite web |author=Paul Rogers |url=http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/the-titanic-and-the-indifferent-stranger.html |title=The ''Titanic'' and the Indifferent Stranger |publisher=Encyclopedia-titanica.org |date=24 July 2009 |access-date=28 May 2013 |archive-date=5 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605091734/http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/the-titanic-and-the-indifferent-stranger.html |url-status=live }}</ref>}}

=== Survivors and victims ===
{{main|Passengers of the Titanic|l1=Passengers of the ''Titanic''}}
<!--[[File:Titanic casualties.svg|thumb|Breakdown of casualties according to the British Board of Trade report [[Media:Titanic casualties.svg|(click for detail)]]]] May be read in the subarticle, please don't clutter.-->

The number of casualties of the sinking is unclear, because of a number of factors. These include confusion over the passenger list, which included some names of people who cancelled their trip at the last minute, and the fact that several passengers travelled under aliases for various reasons and were therefore double-counted on the casualty lists.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=239}} The death toll has been put at between 1,490 and 1,635 people.{{sfn|Lord|1976|p=197}} The tables below use figures from the British [[Board of Trade]] report on the disaster.{{sfn|Mersey|1912|pp=110–111}} While the use of the Marconi wireless system did not achieve the result of bringing a rescue ship to ''Titanic'' before it sank, the use of wireless did bring ''Carpathia'' in time to rescue some of the survivors who otherwise would have perished due to exposure.<ref name="auto"/>

The water temperature was well below normal in the area where ''Titanic'' sank. It also contributed to the rapid death of many passengers during the sinking. Water temperature readings taken around the time of the accident were reported to be {{convert|-2|°C||abbr=}}. Typical water temperatures were normally around {{convert|7|°C||abbr=}} during mid-April.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/post/the-weather-during-the-titanic-disaster-looking-back-100-years/2012/04/11/gIQAAv6SAT_blog.html|title=The weather during the Titanic disaster: looking back 100 years|first=Don|last=Lipman|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=11 April 2012|access-date=24 November 2019|archive-date=6 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210106103005/https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/post/the-weather-during-the-titanic-disaster-looking-back-100-years/2012/04/11/gIQAAv6SAT_blog.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The coldness of the water was a critical factor, often causing death within minutes for many of those in the water.

Fewer than a third of those aboard ''Titanic'' survived the disaster. Some survivors died shortly afterwards; injuries and the effects of exposure caused the deaths of several of those brought aboard ''Carpathia''.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1994|p=179}} The figures show stark differences in the survival rates of the different classes aboard ''Titanic''. Although only 3% of first-class women were lost, 54% of those in third-class died. Similarly, five of six first-class and all second-class children survived, but 52 of the 79 in third-class perished. The differences by gender were even bigger: nearly all female crew members, first- and second-class passengers were saved. Men from the First Class died at a higher rate than women from the Third Class.{{sfn|Howells|1999|p=94}} In total, 50% of the children survived, 20% of the men and 75% of the women.

=== Retrieval and burial of the dead ===
[[File:RMS Titanic Graves in Fairview Cemetery.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph|Markers of ''Titanic'' victims, [[Fairview Cemetery, Halifax, Nova Scotia|Fairview Cemetery]], Halifax, Nova Scotia]]
Once the massive loss of life became known, White Star Line chartered the cable ship [[CS Mackay-Bennett|CS ''Mackay-Bennett'']] from [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]], to retrieve bodies.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=228}} Three other Canadian ships followed in the search: the cable ship ''Minia'',{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=232}} lighthouse supply ship ''Montmagny'' and [[seal hunting|sealing vessel]] ''Algerine''.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=234}} Each ship left with embalming supplies, undertakers, and clergy. Of the 333 victims that were eventually recovered, 328 were retrieved by the Canadian ships and five more by passing North Atlantic steamships.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=225}}{{efn|Most of the bodies were numbered; however, the five passengers [[burial at sea|buried at sea]] by ''Carpathia'' went unnumbered.<ref name="gov ns ca bodies"/>}}

The first ship to reach the site of the sinking, the CS&nbsp;''Mackay-Bennett'', found so many bodies that the embalming supplies aboard were quickly exhausted. Health regulations required that only embalmed bodies could be returned to port.<ref name="gov ns ca victims"/> Captain Larnder of the ''Mackay-Bennett'' and undertakers aboard decided to preserve only the bodies of first-class passengers, justifying their decision by the need to visually identify wealthy men to resolve any disputes over large estates. As a result, many third-class passengers and crew were buried at sea. Larnder identified many of those buried at sea as crew members by their clothing, and stated that as a mariner, he himself would be contented to be buried at sea.<ref name="funeral ship"/>

Bodies recovered were preserved for transport to Halifax, the closest city to the sinking with direct rail and steamship connections. The Halifax Registrar of Vital Statistics, [[John Henry Barnstead]], developed a detailed system to identify bodies and safeguard personal possessions. Relatives from across North America came to identify and claim bodies. A large temporary morgue was set up in the [[curling]] rink of the [[Mayflower Curling Club]] and undertakers were called in from all across eastern Canada to assist.<ref name="funeral ship"/> Some bodies were shipped to be buried in their home towns across North America and Europe. About two-thirds of the bodies were identified. Unidentified victims were buried with simple numbers based on the order in which their bodies were discovered. The majority of recovered victims, 150 bodies, were buried in three Halifax cemeteries, the largest being [[Fairview Cemetery, Halifax, Nova Scotia|Fairview Lawn Cemetery]] followed by the nearby [[Mount Olivet Cemetery (Halifax)|Mount Olivet]] and [[Baron de Hirsch Cemetery, Halifax|Baron de Hirsch]] cemeteries.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|pp=244–245}}

In mid-May 1912, {{RMS|Oceanic|1899|6}} recovered three bodies over {{convert|200|mi|km}} from the site of the sinking who were among the original occupants of Collapsible A. When Fifth Officer [[Harold Lowe]] and six crewmen returned to the wreck site sometime after the sinking in a lifeboat to pick up survivors, they rescued a dozen males and one female from Collapsible A, but left the dead bodies of three of its occupants.{{efn|Thomson Beattie, a first class passenger, and two crew members, a fireman and a seaman.}} After their retrieval from Collapsible A by ''Oceanic'', the bodies were buried at sea.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|pp=242–243}}

The last ''Titanic'' body recovered was steward James McGrady, Body No. 330, found by the chartered Newfoundland sealing vessel ''Algerine'' on 22 May and buried at [[Fairview Cemetery, Halifax, Nova Scotia|Fairview Lawn Cemetery]] in Halifax on 12 June.<ref>Alan Ruffman, ''Titanic Remembered: The Unsinkable Ship and Halifax'' Formac Publishing (1999), p. 38.</ref>

Only 333 bodies of ''Titanic'' victims were recovered, which amounted to one in five of the over 1,500 victims. Some bodies sank with the ship while currents quickly dispersed bodies and wreckage across hundreds of miles, making them difficult to recover. By June, one of the last search ships reported that life jackets supporting bodies were coming apart and releasing bodies to sink.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://museum.gov.ns.ca/mmanew/en/home/whattoseedo/Titanic/FAQ.aspx#5 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125202240/http://museum.gov.ns.ca/mmanew/en/home/whattoseedo/Titanic/FAQ.aspx#5 |archive-date=25 January 2013 |title=Why So Few? |publisher=Museum.gov.ns.ca |access-date=28 May 2013}}</ref>

Bodies of [[passengers of the Titanic]] were numbered as they were brought aboard. Physical characteristics, clothing, identifying marks, and personal effects were all documented. Personal effects were stored separately, labeled with the same body number, and valuables were locked up by the purser. Without enough material or space to handle bodies and their belongings, the crew had to triage.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Wills |first=Matthew |date=2022-06-21 |title=Bodies of the Titanic: Found and Lost Again |url=https://daily.jstor.org/bodies-of-the-titanic-found-and-lost-again/ |access-date=2023-09-26 |website=JSTOR Daily |language=en-US}}</ref>

''Titanic'' was long thought to have sunk in one piece and, over the years, many schemes were put forward for raising the wreck. None came to fruition.{{sfn|Ward|2012|p=166}} The fundamental problem was the sheer difficulty of finding and reaching a wreck that lies over {{convert|12000|ft|m}} below the surface, where the water pressure is over {{convert|5000|psi|MPa|abbr=off|sigfig=1}}, about 400 [[Standard atmosphere (unit)|standard atmospheres]]. A number of expeditions were mounted to find ''Titanic'' but it was not until 1 September 1985 that a Franco-American expedition led by [[Jean-Louis Michel (oceanographer)|Jean-Louis Michel]] and [[Robert Ballard]] succeeded.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimclash/2017/01/21/titanic-speaks-to-oceanographer-who-found-wreck-at-bottom-of-the-atlantic/|title=Titanic Speaks To Oceanographer Who Found Wreck at Bottom of the Atlantic|last=Clash|first=Jim|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=22 March 2020|archive-date=6 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210106103026/https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimclash/2017/01/21/titanic-speaks-to-oceanographer-who-found-wreck-at-bottom-of-the-atlantic/|url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfn|Ward|2012|pp=171–172}}<ref>{{cite news|title=Paper says Titanic discovered|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/834054/paper_says_titanic_discovered/|work=The San Bernardino County Sun|date=1 September 1985|page=3|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|access-date=26 July 2016|archive-date=27 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627202654/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/834054/paper_says_titanic_discovered/|url-status=live}} {{Open access}}</ref>

The team discovered that ''Titanic'' had in fact split apart, probably near or at the surface, before sinking to the seabed. The separated bow and stern sections lie about a third of a mile (0.6&nbsp;km) apart in [[Titanic Canyon]] off the coast of Newfoundland. They are located {{convert|13.2|mi|km}} from the inaccurate coordinates given by ''Titanic''{{'}}s radio operators on the night of her sinking,{{sfn|Halpern|Weeks|2011|pp=126–127}} and approximately {{convert|715|mi|0|abbr=out}} from Halifax and {{convert|1250|mi|0|abbr=out}} from New York.

Both sections struck the seabed at considerable speed, causing the bow to crumple and the stern to collapse entirely. The bow is by far the more intact section and still contains some surprisingly intact interiors. In contrast, the stern is completely wrecked; its decks have pancaked down on top of each other and much of the hull plating was torn off and lies scattered across the sea floor. The much greater level of damage to the stern is probably due to structural damage incurred during the sinking. Thus weakened, the remainder of the stern was flattened by the impact with the sea bed.{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=205}}

The two sections are surrounded by a debris field measuring approximately {{convert|5|x|3|mi|km|sigfig=1}}.{{sfn|Canfield|2012}} It contains hundreds of thousands of items, such as pieces of the ship, furniture, dinnerware and personal items, which fell from the ship as she sank or were ejected when the bow and stern impacted on the sea floor.{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=203}} The debris field was also the last resting place of a number of ''Titanic''{{'s}} victims. Most of the bodies and clothes were consumed by sea creatures and bacteria, leaving pairs of shoes and boots—which have proved to be inedible—as the only sign that bodies once lay there.{{sfn|Ballard|1987|p=207}}

Since its initial discovery, the wreck of ''Titanic'' has been revisited on numerous occasions by explorers, scientists, filmmakers, tourists and salvagers, who have recovered thousands of items from the debris field for conservation and public display. The ship's condition has deteriorated significantly over the years, particularly from accidental damage by [[submersible]]s but mostly because of an accelerating rate of growth of iron-eating bacteria on the hull.{{sfn|Ward|2012|p=171}} In 2006, it was estimated that within 50 years the hull and structure of ''Titanic'' would eventually collapse entirely, leaving only the more durable interior fittings of the ship intermingled with a pile of rust on the sea floor.{{sfn|Crosbie|Mortimer|2006|p=last page (no page number specified)}}

After the disaster, recommendations were made by both the British and American Boards of Inquiry stating that ships should carry enough lifeboats for all aboard, mandated lifeboat drills would be implemented, lifeboat inspections would be conducted, etc. Many of these recommendations were incorporated into the [[International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea]] passed in 1914.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.captainsvoyage-forum.com/showthread.php/1294-SOLAS-and-the-requirement-of-lifeboats-on-passenger-vessels |title=Captainsvoyage-forum, lifeboat requirements |publisher=Captainsvoyage-forum.com |access-date=28 May 2013}}</ref> The convention has been updated by periodic amendments, with a completely new version adopted in 1974.<ref name="IMO-1974">''[http://www.imo.org/About/Conventions/ListOfConventions/Pages/International-Convention-for-the-Safety-of-Life-at-Sea-(SOLAS),-1974.aspx International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607173502/http://www.imo.org/About/Conventions/listofconventions/pages/international-convention-for-the-safety-of-life-at-sea-(solas),-1974.aspx |date=7 June 2015 }}''. [[International Maritime Organization]], 1974.</ref> Signatories to the Convention followed up with national legislation to implement the new standards. For example, in Britain, new "Rules for Life Saving Appliances" were passed by the [[Board of Trade]] on 8 May 1914 and then applied at a meeting of British steamship companies in Liverpool in June 1914.<ref>{{cite web |last=Conlin |first=Dan |url=http://marinecurator.blogspot.ca/2013/04/new-artifact-titanic-report-that.html |title=A Titanic Report that Changed History |publisher=Marinecurator.blogspot.ca |date=15 April 2013 |access-date=28 May 2013 |archive-date=15 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415080851/http://marinecurator.blogspot.ca/2013/04/new-artifact-titanic-report-that.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Further, the United States government passed the [[Radio Act of 1912]]. This Act, along with the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, stated that radio communications on passenger ships would be operated 24 hours a day, along with a secondary power supply, so as not to miss distress calls. Also, the Radio Act of 1912 required ships to maintain contact with vessels in their vicinity as well as coastal onshore radio stations.<ref name="marconi">{{cite web|last=Minichiello, P.E. |first=Ray |title=Titanic Tragedy Spawns Wireless Advancements |publisher=The Guglielmo Marconi Foundation, U.S.A., Inc. |url=http://www.marconiusa.org/history/titanic.htm |access-date=30 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19981203092341/http://www.marconiusa.org/history/titanic.htm |archive-date=3 December 1998 }}</ref> In addition, it was agreed in the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea that the firing of red rockets from a ship must be interpreted as a sign of need for help. Once the Radio Act of 1912 was passed, it was agreed that rockets at sea would be interpreted as distress signals only, thus removing any possible misinterpretation from other ships.<ref name="marconi"/> In the same year, the [[Board of Trade]] [[bareboat charter|chartered]] the [[barque]] {{ship||Scotia|barque|2}} to act as a [[weather ship]] in the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]], keeping a look-out for icebergs. A Marconi wireless telegraph was installed to enable her to communicate with stations on the coast of [[Labrador]] and [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]].<ref name=Times150213>{{Cite newspaper The Times |title=The ice danger in the North Atlantic |date=15 February 1913 |page=4 |issue=40136 |column=C }}</ref><ref name=Stamp>{{cite web |url=http://www.mikeskidmore.supanet.com/st-br-scotia.htm |title=45p SY Scotia |publisher=Mike Skidmore |access-date=17 July 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030922142819/http://www.mikeskidmore.supanet.com/st-br-scotia.htm |archive-date=22 September 2003 }}</ref>

Finally, the disaster led to the formation and international funding of the [[International Ice Patrol]], an agency of the U.S. Coast Guard that to the present day monitors and reports on the location of North Atlantic Ocean icebergs that could pose a threat to transatlantic sea traffic. Coast Guard aircraft conduct the primary reconnaissance. In addition, information is collected from ships operating in or passing through the ice area. Except for the years of the two World Wars, the International Ice Patrol has worked each season since 1913. During the period, there has not been a single reported loss of life or property due to collision with an iceberg in the patrol area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/index.php?pageName=IIPHome |title=Navigation Center, Ice Patrol |publisher=Navcen.uscg.gov |access-date=28 May 2013 |archive-date=22 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722074837/http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/index.php?pageName=IIPHome |url-status=live }}</ref>

''Titanic'' has gone down in history as the ship that was called unsinkable.{{efn|An example is Daniel Butler's book about RMS ''Titanic'', titled ''Unsinkable''.}} For more than 100 years, she has been the inspiration of fiction and non-fiction.

The ''Titanic'' disaster was commemorated through a variety of memorials and monuments to the victims, erected in several English-speaking countries and in particular in cities that had suffered notable losses. These included Southampton and Liverpool in England; New York and Washington, D.C. in the United States; and [[Belfast]] and [[Cobh]] (formerly Queenstown) in Ireland.{{sfn|Spignesi|2012|pp=262–263}} A number of museums around the world have displays on ''Titanic''; the most prominent is in Belfast, the ship's birthplace (see [[#In Northern Ireland|below]]).

In a frequently commented-on literary coincidence, [[Morgan Robertson]] authored a novel called ''[[Futility, or the Wreck of the Titan|Futility]]'' in 1898 about a fictional British passenger liner with the plot bearing a number of similarities to the ''Titanic'' disaster.

==== In Northern Ireland ====
It took many decades before the significance of ''Titanic'' was promoted in [[Northern Ireland]], where it was built by [[Harland and Wolff]] in [[Belfast]]. While the rest of the world embraced the glory and tragedy of ''Titanic'', it remained a taboo subject throughout the 20th century in its birth city. The sinking brought tremendous grief and was a blow to Belfast's pride.
